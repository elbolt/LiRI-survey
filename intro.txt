**CLARIN-CH** and the **Statistics and Research Analytics team** at **LiRI** plan to host an online workshop on statistical power analysis on **June 6, 2025**, from **15:30 to 17:00**.

Power analysis is a topic that frequently comes up in our consultations. This short workshop is intended for CLARIN-CH and LiRI-affiliated researchers, as well as anyone else interested. Its goal is to refresh your knowledge and provide a practical recipe for approaching power analysis in your next projectâ€”or, at the very least, to help you know where to turn for support when you need it.


To make the most of our limited time, we would like to tailor the session to your interests and needs. Please take a moment to answer the short survey below.

If you would like to provide further input, feel free to reach out to Elena, elena[dot]bolt[at]uzh[dot]ch.
